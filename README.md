## Presentations ##

This is my repo for all presentations. I will try to keep up to date with the abstracts, slides, and all the supporting code and links here. This repo is organized by year. Each year has a subdirectory with the presentation title, and supporting information. I try to update old presentations with new information, when I do so, I will *move* them to a new year so the old directory structure and presentation stays in tact for reference later (w/o having to use version control to see it).

My bio should be up to date here:
