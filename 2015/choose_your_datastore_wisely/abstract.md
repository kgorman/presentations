## But choose wisely, for while the true database will bring you life, the false database will take it from you.

The data store you choose to build your application and perhaps your business on has the potential to make your life miserable. If you choose wisely you probably won't hear much about it, won't worry about it, and may sleep more. It's all up to you to choose the best tool for the job.

Kenny will discuss various data patterns and fits for various popular data stores like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Hadoop and some others. He will discuss relational, non-relational, structured and unstructured data and compare and contrast various designs, approaches, and anti-patterns.

Attendees will leave armed with the ability to choose wisely and just maybe sleep a bit more.
