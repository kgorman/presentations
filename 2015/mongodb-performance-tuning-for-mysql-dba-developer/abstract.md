# MONGODB PERFORMANCE TUNING FOR MYSQL DBA'S AND DEVELOPERS

So you are a DBA or Developer, but you want to be able to have the skills to tune and troubleshoot MongoDB performance? Maybe you already know some MongoDB, but you want to increase your skills? This is your session.

Kenny will present an overview of MongoDB performance tuning, he will use analogies to the traditional SQL world (using MySQL and Oracle references), as well as explain key differences in the architecture of MongoDB as compared to relational databases. He will present the MongoDB profiler from simple examples to advanced analysis using the aggregation framework.

Kenny will tell some war stories about performance tuning at eBay/Paypal, Shutterfly and ObjectRocket, using them to help underscore various tuning techniques and approaches.

Attendees will leave armed with the ability to spot poorly performing operations and have the skills to do something about it. Attendees will leave with code samples, snippets and examples.
