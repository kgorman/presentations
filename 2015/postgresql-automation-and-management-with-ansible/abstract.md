## PostgreSQL automation and management with Ansible

The Ansible automation framework makes it very easy to provision infrastructure, but it's also fantastic for managing PostgreSQL systems.

Kenny Gorman will discuss using Ansible in a production PostgreSQL environment. He will demonstrate how to use Ansible playbooks, roles, and modules to scale, tune, and manage PostgreSQL databases. He will go over backups, user management, performance management, scale-out and streaming replication use cases.

Attendees will leave with the knowledge and some sample code to use Ansible to help them get started and use it in their own bag of tricks. If you are interested in how to manage large numbers of PostgreSQL servers, or just need to ensure your single server is happy, this is the talk for you.
