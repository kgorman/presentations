## Polyglot Persistence @ Rackspace

We are in the middle of a data revolution. There has never been more choices for Developers, DevOps, and Engineers when selecting a data storage technology. In fact, successful projects are often weaved from an array of components and data technologies.  Kenny Gorman will present how to wade through the myriad of data and database options, and present a framework for thinking about how to choose which technologies make sense for what types of projects. He will discuss relational technologies, NoSQL stores, and big and small data frameworks. You will leave armed with the ability to understand what data technologies may fit your projects and how to make the most of this data revolution.
